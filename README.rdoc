This is an Individual Rails project done in three weeks in November 2014 that takes CSV data on each mental health facility in the United States and parses it to create a searchable database using custom jQuery.  It uses various Google Maps APIs, exposes an API that others can use, uses background workers, and also pulls articles from various psychology RSS feeds.
